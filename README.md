# web-scraping-covid19

This project involves web scraping data related to the COVID-19 pandemic from three different websites: PRS India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), and COVID-19 India.

The first website, PRS India (https://prsindia.org/), provides valuable information about the COVID-19 pandemic in India, including various statistics, reports, and updates. Through web scraping, we extract relevant data such as government responses, policies, and official documents to gain insights into the legislative and policy landscape surrounding the pandemic.

The second website, MOHFW (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/), serves as the official website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India. By utilizing web scraping techniques, we gather COVID-19 data such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases at the national and state levels. This data helps in tracking the spread of the virus and understanding the overall situation in India.

The third website, COVID-19 India (https://www.covid19india.org/), is a prominent platform that provides comprehensive and up-to-date COVID-19 statistics for India. We extract state- and district-wise data on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases through web scraping. This data is valuable for monitoring the impact of the virus across different regions of the country.

By scraping data from these three websites, we aim to compile and analyze COVID-19 information to enhance understanding, track trends, and support decision-making processes. The extracted data can be used for research, visualizations, and creating data-driven solutions to combat the pandemic.

Note: It is important to respect the terms of use and policies of the websites being scraped and to ensure that the web scraping process is conducted responsibly and ethically, adhering to any applicable legal and ethical guidelines.
